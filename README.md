## Description
This is a small music player project created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS files. The various features of the music player like audio playback and skipping tracks are controlled by functions within the musicplayer.js file. The song files are stock audio from Adobe's stock audio website. The icons used in this project are imported from Font Awesome's website. My objective for this website was to understand how to play audio through a web application hosted on the internet. I also listen to music daily so I thought it would be fun to incorporate activities that I do in my daily life into my work. One of my hobbies is music creation and programming is another way that I can have fun showcasing it. 

## Conclusion

This project was created for me to understand JavaScript a bit more.
I also wanted to learn how to be more creative with using JavaScript.
It was a pleasure to work on this and I'd like to learn how to be more creative with JavaScript in the future.
