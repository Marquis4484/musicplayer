## Description

This is a small music player project created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS files.
The various features on the music player are controlled by functions within the musicplayer.js file.
The song files were retrieved from https://stock.adobe.com/audio.
The icons used in this project are from Font Awesome's website.

## Conclusion

This project was created for me to understand JavaScript a bit more.
I also wanted to learn how to be more creative about using JavaScript.
It was a pleasure to work on this and I'd like to to learn how to be more creative with JavaScript in the future.
